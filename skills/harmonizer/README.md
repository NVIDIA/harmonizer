# harmonizer agent skill

An [agent skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) that installs and
drives NVIDIA DiffusionHarmonizer. `SKILL.md` is the entry point; the agent
runtime loads it and the files it references.

Installed skills are resolved by the `name:` field in `SKILL.md`
(`harmonizer`), typically into `.claude/skills/<name>/` or
`.agents/skills/<name>/`.

## License

This directory is released under dual **CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache-2.0** terms,
which is what the `SKILL.md` frontmatter records as
`license: CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache-2.0`. Every file here is covered:

| Files | License |
|---|---|
| `scripts/` (`validate_setup.py`, `.env.example`) | **Apache-2.0**, same as the rest of this repository. Source files carry `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` headers. Full text travels with this directory in [`LICENSE-Apache-2.0.txt`](./LICENSE-Apache-2.0.txt). |
| `SKILL.md`, `skill-card.md`, `references/`, `evals/`, this `README.md` | dual **CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache-2.0**. Full Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International text: [`LICENSE-CC-BY-4.0`](./LICENSE-CC-BY-4.0). |

This directory is designed to be copied out standalone into an agent skills
directory, so both licence texts and the [`NOTICE`](./NOTICE) attribution
travel with it rather than being reachable only from the repository root.

The repository root `LICENSE` covers this project's own source as
Apache-2.0. That remains true; the CC-BY-4.0 terms above apply **only to the
documentation inside this skill directory**.

## Provenance

This skill was authored in NVIDIA's NuRec Skills repository
(<https://github.com/NVIDIA/nurec-skills>, `main` at `5b9d287`, 2026-09-02),
where it was named `nurec-fixer`. Its documentation was already licensed
under the same dual CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache-2.0 terms; that licensing is carried
over unchanged rather than re-granted.

It was modified when it moved here: renamed `nurec-fixer` → `harmonizer`,
references to sibling skills that do not ship in this repository reduced to
plain names, and NRE-specific content removed.

The skill only *drives* upstream artifacts — this repository's code, and
Hugging Face models and datasets. Those retain their own licenses; see the
`metadata:` block in `SKILL.md` for the upstream pointers.
